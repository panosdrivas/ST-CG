Implementation of the Steep Descent and Conjugate Gradients methods for the solution of two linear systems. The measurements presented refer to the following sizes of the linear systems: 100, 1000, 10000. The required repetitions are also measured so that the two methods can be compared for both of the two linear systems in terms of the speed of convergence
